The following contains my code, in Go, for the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) sets. In every set folder there are the corresponding exercises and a markdown file of learning notes for the set.

Shoutout to [Filippo Valsorda](twitter.com/FiloSottile) for his [Cryptopals Livstreaming](https://blog.filippo.io/live-streaming-cryptopals/), which helped immensely.
